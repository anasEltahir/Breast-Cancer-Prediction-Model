# ðŸ©º Breast Cancer Classification using Logistic Regression

## ðŸ“– Overview
This project uses **Logistic Regression** to classify breast tumors as **malignant (cancer)** or **benign (non-cancer)**, based on the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset**.  
It is designed as part of a classification learning project for my 3rd-year Mechatronics Engineering studies.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals
- **Accurately classify** tumors with a strong **recall score** for malignant cases (to minimize false negatives in cancer detection).
- Apply **data exploration, visualization, preprocessing, and model evaluation** in a complete machine learning workflow.
- Provide both a **Python script** and a **Streamlit web app** for interactive predictions.

## ðŸ“Š Workflow
1. **Load & Explore Data**  
2. **Correlation Analysis**  
3. **Visualization**  
4. **Data Preprocessing**  
5. **Model Training**  
6. **Evaluation**  
7. **Deployment (optional)**
